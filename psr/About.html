      <section class="col s12 panel">

        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>At the top of the review is a picture of each of the poses in the set, and any other significant pieces such as vehicles etc. Below each piece is a number indicating how many of that figure are in the set. If there is no number then the numbers of each pose are variable. Most of these figures are supplied unpainted, but for some reviews we have painted the figures ourselves, partly because they look better that way, but mainly because we like to paint them and show them off too. Most reviews with our painted figures also have a button below the pictures which will display the same figures unpainted (as painting can distort the actual quality of a figure).</p>

        <p>Below the images are the basic details of the set, namely the manufacturer and set code, along with the date that the review was written. Where this date is missing it was writen before we introduced this feature.</p>

        <h2>Stats</h2>
        <p>Next is the Stats section, where key aspects on the set are given. These are:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The date that the set was first released (The set may have been released later in some parts of the World).
          </li>
          <li>
            The number of unique human poses in a normal set. Groups moulded as one piece will still count as several poses.
          </li>
          <li>
            The colour of the material in which the set was made. This will include all reissues, including those under licence by other manufacturers. The description of the colour is general rather than going into specifics about shade and so forth.
          </li>
          <li>
            The number of figures in a normal set. This is the number of human beings, not the number of pieces. Thus horses, animals, bits of kit etc are not counted, but pieces where two or more people are moulded together will count each person represented - even stretcher cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            The material used to make the figures, which can be either plastic or resin. When the material is plastic, there is also an indication of the consistency of the plastic, ranging from very soft to very hard. Sets made of polystyrene or similar are always labelled as 'hard', while Polyethyline and other kinds of plastic can vary greatly in consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Average human height gives an idea of the size and scale of the figures. While all the figures reviewed are roughly 1:72 scale, some are still bigger than others. This value gives the average height in milimetres of all those poses which are standing reasonably straight, and in brackets the actual height in metres that this would represent at true 1:72 scale. For our purposes we define height to be from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head. Those figures in HO or similar scale are still judged in the same way as the rest, so will normally be shown to be small. Next to the figure is a graphic showing whether this height is correct for the subject of the set. As human height has varied through history the ideal height will vary between sets. Move the mouse over this graphic for an explanation.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Below the stats section is the text of the review, which is a commentary on the set. This can pretty much include anything the reviewer wants to include, but will mostly be concerned with all the particularly good and/or bad points as well as a general impression. When compiling a review, the following points are considered:</p>

        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>
            History or story of the set
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Author Ratings</h2>
        <p>Next come the author ratings, which are the scores given by the review author for key set characteristics. Each rating has a maximum of 10 points, with 0 being absolutely dreadful and 10 being perfect or as close as you're likely to get.</p>

        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>
            Historical Accuracy covers the accuracy of the uniform and equipment, and the suitability of the poses for the subject.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pose covers how good the variety of poses is, how suitable they are for the subject and also originality in pose selection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pose Number covers the number of appropriate poses included in the set, bearing in mind the subject matter. In broad terms the set will score maximum points if it contains 20+ poses (infantry), 10+ poses (cavalry or artillery), although the actual subject matter is always taken into consideration and scores will depend on how many poses the subject matter might ideally expect.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sculpting covers the level of detail attempted, how crisp and well defined that detail is, how anatomically correct the figures are, how natural the poses seem, how well issues of undercutting have been addressed or avoided. In short, all about the skill of the original sculptor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mould covers how well the figures have been moulded - for example air bubbles in the mould can produce holes in the piece, stunted or missing equipment or limbs. Also the amount of flash and other extranneous sprue that needs to be removed from the figures.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Ratings</h2>
        <p>User ratings are where visitors can give an overall score for the set. This is yet to be defined...</p>

        <h2>Review Notes</h2>
        <p>Review notes gives a brief outline of how the review should be understood, and a link to this page for full notes. </p>

        <p>Further reading is where we detail any books, magazines or other articles which were consulted during the preparation of the review, or which may offer further useful information for anyone who purchases the set. This is not necessarily an exhausive list, and it does not include links to pages on the internet as these can often change and would be troublesome to maintain properly.</p>

        <h2>Related Reviews</h2>
        <p>Related Reviews lists reviews that cover sets for the same subject, and so are a possible alternative. To avoid this list becoming excessively long, only matching sets are listed, not those that are similar or can be placed together (e.g. opponants).</p>

        <h2>Caveat Emptor</h2>
        <p>Remember that this web site is all about reviews, which are necessarily dependant on the opinion of the reviewer. You may find that you strongly disagree with some of the opinions or scores. What we have tried to do is give as much information as possible so you can decide what may be worthy of purchase. However, if you intend to buy many copies of a particular set then it would still be wise to buy just one first to ensure it meets your needs.</p>
  
        <h2>We're only human</h2>
        <p>Finally, where statements have been made as fact we have tried to ensure they are correct. If we have made a mistake, please let us know via the Contact page - we are only human after all and are happy to make corrections.</p>
